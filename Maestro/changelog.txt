Test Build 1
------------

First public preview release of Maestro 3.0.
 
 - Redesigned User Interface
	- Now driven by the SharpDevelop Core framework
		- Allows for easy customization of user interfaces.
		- AddIn infrastructure allows for easy addition of new functionality.

		- Some example commands which were previously not possible.
			- Delete selected resources
			- Validate selected resources
			- Package selected resources
 - Rewritten resource editor infrastructure
	- One editor per resource type / version
	- Uses the INotifyPropertyChanged databinding infrastructure
	- Allow for upgrades to newer versions of a resource type (eg. LayerDefinition 1.0.0 to LayerDefinition 1.3.0). Upgrades are manual and explicit, with a firefox-style notification bar to indicate whether a resource can be upgraded.
	- Resources types and/or versions without a specialized editor default to the XML editor.
	- Support for browsing Symbol Libraries
	- Flexible new resource templates
	- New specialized editors for
		- Drawing Source
		- Print Layout
	- Enhancements to existing specialized editors

		- Connection interface is now separated into service specific sub-interfaces
			- IResourceService
			- IFeatureService
			- etc.
	- Cleaner resource object model

		- Base library includes resource classes generated from v1.0.0 xsd schemas.
		- Classes generated from newer xsd schemas reside in their own separate assembly.
	- New connections capabilities API
		- Allows interrogation of supported features/commands depending on implementation and mapguide server version.
	- Custom command API
		- Allows for custom functionality which may only work for newer versions of MapGuide.
 - Other New Features and Changes
	- Load Procedure validation support
	- API and UI support for listening to outbound requests. You can now view outbound requests of your MapGuide Server connections
