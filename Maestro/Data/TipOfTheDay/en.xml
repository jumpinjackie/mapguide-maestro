        If you want to use Google/Bing/Yahoo maps with Fusion, your Map Definition
        needs to be in the Popular Visualisation Mercator coordinate system.

        The coordinate system code for this is WGS84.PseudoMercator
    </TipOfTheDay>

        If you want to use Google/Bing/Yahoo maps with Fusion, Google and Yahoo maps
        require API keys. Bing does not require API keys.

        Please carefully read the terms and conditions of each respective mapping
        provider.
