# There are many definitions of the Clarke 1858 ellipsoid.  These differences
# result from different assumptions concerning which "British Foot" was used
# in determining the ellipsoid, and the subsequent differences upon converting
# to meters.  The differences are on the order of 2 centimeters.  The following
# values were provided by a client of Mentor Software, the original developer
# of the CS-MAP library, and differ from EPSG by 1 centimeter.
# Best guess is that the original definition was a radius of 20,926,348 British
# feet and a Inverse Flattening of 294.26068.  You get to pick what definition
# of the British Foot you want to use; and choose to round the flattening off to
# 294.26 as is commonly done.
