-------------

Version: 0.9.26.0
Release Date: June 17, 2009
Author: Eugene Ciloci

What is it?
-----------
A .NET library that allows you to parse, compile, and evaluate expressions.  Its main distinguishing feature is that it uses a custom compiler to convert expressions to IL and then emits them to a dynamic method at runtime.  This ensures that expression evaluation is fast and efficient.

What license does it use?
-------------------------
The library is licensed under the LGPL.

Dependencies
------------
The library uses the excellent grammatica parser generator to handle formula parsing.
It is also licensed under the LGPL and you can get the latest version at: http://grammatica.percederberg.net/
The tests use NUnit.
