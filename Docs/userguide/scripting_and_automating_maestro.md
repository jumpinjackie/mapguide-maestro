# Scripting and Automating Maestro

As mentioned in the section (<xref:user-interface>), Maestro includes an **IronPython Console** which provides the user an interactive scripting environment to drive and automate certain parts of the Maestro application with IronPython code

## About IronPython

IronPython is an open source implementation of the Python programming language which is tightly integrated with the .net Framework. IronPython can use the .net Framework and Python libraries and also allows for .net applications to easily use Python code.

Maestro embeds an IronPython scripting engine allowing for easy scripting and automation of the application by users.

## The Host Application

The IronPython Console exposes a top-level global object named `app`, which represents the Maestro Host Application. The Host Application provides the following services:

 * Displaying messages/questions in a dialog box
 * Displaying file pickers for file selection
 * Obtaining <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.IServerConnection> references
 * Convenience methods to fetch/set resource XML content by their resource id
 * A UI-thread invoker for running UI interaction code from a background thread

The <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.IServerConnection> interface represents the top-level interface of the Maestro API and is the gateway into most of the functionality that is offered by the Maestro API.

Each root node (connection) in the **Site Explorer** represents an <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.IServerConnection> instance. The Host Application gives you the ability to retrieve such instances in order to be able to work with resources under that connection instance.

You can bring up documentation of any object or function with the `help` command. For example, to describe the structure of our global Host Application:

    >>> help(app)

## Loading scripts

The IronPython console also supports loading pre-defined scripts. Click **Run File** and select the python script you want to load.

![](../images/ironpython_runfile.png)

All classes and functions defined in that python script will be loaded into the console's global namespace.

## Example scripts

You can find some example scripts [here](http://trac.osgeo.org/mapguide/wiki/CodeSamples/Other/MaestroScripts) which may give you some ideas as to what you can do through scripting and automation with IronPython
