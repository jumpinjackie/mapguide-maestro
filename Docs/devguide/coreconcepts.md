## Connections

### Overview

Connections are the primary entry point into the functionality offered by the
Maestro API. It abstracts away the various methods of interacting with a MapGuide
Server into a single unified interface

### Known Implementations

There are 3 known implementations of the <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.IServerConnection> interface:

 * `Maestro.Http`: A HTTP implementation (that communicates with the http mapagent)
 * `Maestro.LocalNative`: A Local Native implementation (that wraps the official MapGuide API)
 * `Maestro.Local`: A Local implementation (that wraps the [mg-desktop](http://trac.osgeo.org/mapguide/wiki/mg-desktop) API)	

## Service Interfaces

A connection is represented by the <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.IServerConnection> interface. Creating such connections is done via the <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.ConnectionProviderRegistry>
class. This class uses the `ConnectionProviders.xml` file to resolve and load the matching implementation

Additional implementations can be registered in the `ConnectionProviders.xml` file

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with the **6.0m8** release, the `Maestro.Http` provider is built into the Maestro API itself. The `ConnectionProviders.xml`
> file is not required if you are only using this connection provider.

All examples outlined in this guide assume the use of the HTTP implementation (`Maestro.Http`)

## Resource Objects

### Overview

Unlike the official MapGuide API, all resources in the Maestro API are strongly-typed objects
and not blobs of arbitrary XML content that needs to be manually processed and manipulated by your
application.

All XML resource elements are represented as classes. These classes are automatically generated
from the respective XSD used to validate this resource content. Because a resource can have many
different schema versions, these classes implement a set of common interfaces that reside under the
`OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels` namespace. 

This has 2 benefits:

 * It prevents collision of the autogenerated classes across different versions. The generated classes are partitioned under internal version-specific namespaces
 * By working against the resource interfaces, your code can work with any supported schema version of a given resource. In addition, adding support for newer schema revisions requires no changes on your side

When working with the Maestro API, **always write code against the resource interfaces**. Despite being public types and included in the Maestro API assemblies, never write code against the
autogenerated classes because multiple versions of them exist. It is for this reason that the autogenerated classes are not included in this API documentation.

### Resource Interface Versions

Each schema revision introduces new elements, which require new resource interfaces in the Maestro API that map to these new elements.
In such cases, we adopt the approach of COM interfaces and create a new interface that extends the old one
and incorporates the methods and properties to handle the new elements. The new interface is suffixed with a number
that increases with each new schema revision

For example, the <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.WebLayout.IWebLayout> interface represents the Web Layout resource (version `1.0.0`). The
`1.1.0` schema introduces a new `PingServer` element (to prevent viewer session expiry). To tap into this newly exposed element 
provided by this schema, a <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.WebLayout.IWebLayout2> interface included, which extends the original <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.WebLayout.IWebLayout> interface and includes 
the new <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.WebLayout.IWebLayout2.EnablePingServer> property. All other resource interfaces follow the same pattern of design.

Of course, due to the large number of schema revisions made since the very first release of MapGuide Open Source, it is a bit difficult 
to keep track of all the relevant schema revisions and the resource interfaces that are affected. The following table shows which resource 
schema versions a newer resource interface is applicable to:

| Resource Type              | Interfaces introduced for this version (also applicable for versions after it)                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Layer Definition (v1.1.0)  | <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.IVectorScaleRange2>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.ICompositeTypeStyle>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.ICompositeRule>,<xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.IStroke2>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.ElevationTypeType>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.IElevationSettings>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.ICompositeSymbolization>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.IParameterOverride>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.IParameterOverrideCollection> |
| Layer Definition (v1.2.0)  | <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.ISymbolInstance2>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.IParameterOverride2>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.IThemeLabel>,<xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.UsageContextType>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.GeometryContextType>                                                                                                                     |
| Layer Definition (v1.3.0)  | <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.ICompositeTypeStyle2>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.IAreaVectorStyle2>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.ILineVectorStyle2>,<xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.IPointVectorStyle2> |
| Layer Definition (v2.4.0)  | <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.LayerDefinition.ISubLayerDefinition2> |
| Map Definition (v2.3.0)    | <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.MapDefinition.IMapDefinition2> |
| Map Definition (v3.0.0)    | <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.MapDefinition.IMapDefinition3> |
| Web Layout (v1.1.0)        | <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.WebLayout.IWebLayout2> |
| Symbol Definition (v1.1.0) | <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.SymbolDefinition.ISymbolInstance>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.SymbolDefinition.ITextGraphic2>, <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.SymbolDefinition.DataType2> |
| Symbol Definition (v2.4.0) | <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.SymbolDefinition.IPathGraphic2> |

To determine whether a given interface is accessible, you can either check the ResourceVersion and refer to this 
table to see if these interfaces can be casted from their older versions. Or you can utilise language features 
such as C#'s `as` keyword to cast objects to specific interfaces. If the casted object is not null, then that 
interface is supported.

If you are using C# 7.0 or higher language features, you can take advantage of pattern matching to achieve the same effect

## The Runtime Map

### Overview

The <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.Mapping.RuntimeMap> represents the state of the map that a user is currently looking at in the viewer. It contains all the 
relevant information about the current map: 

 * The current view center and scale
 * The list of <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.Mapping.RuntimeMapLayer> instances that belong to this map
 * The list of <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.Mapping.RuntimeMapGroup> instances that belong to this map
 * The current extents of the map
 * The display width/height/dpi of the map

To obtain a reference to a runtime map, you will have to create one (via <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.Services.IMappingService>.`CreateMap`) or open an existing 
one (via <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.Services.IMappingService>.`OpenMap`). Note that when opening an existing runtime map, you need to supply the resource id 
of the runtime map state 

If given a map name and session id, the runtime map state resource id is usually of the form: 

 `Session:session-id//mapName.Map`

Most of this runtime map state can be manipulated through the APIs provided by the Maestro API. When manipulating the state 
of the runtime map (which also includes modifications to layers and groups that belong to it), you must remember to call 
<xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.Mapping.RuntimeMap.Save> on the map to persist your modifications.

### Compatibility

The RuntimeMap operates on an encoded binary blob on the MapGuide Server that represents the internal state of the runtime map. New 
versions of MapGuide may introduce new states that may break compatibility with the <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.Mapping.RuntimeMap> class. As such, usage of the 
<xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.Mapping.RuntimeMap> in the Maestro API is restricted to the following versions of MapGuide (includes point releases and service packs): 

 * MapGuide Open Source 1.2 and newer
 * Autodesk MapGuide Enterprise / Infrastructure Map Serve 2008 and newer

If you are not using a version of MapGuide that is on this list, there is no guarantee the <xref:OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI.Mapping.RuntimeMap> will work as expected
